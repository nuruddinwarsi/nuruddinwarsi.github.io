1. How do the elements appear? Does the width have any effect? Why / Why not?

   > No effect, width remains same

2. Next, set display to inline. Does it cause any change? Why / Why not?

   > No effect, width remains same

block : Uses up the entire width viewport, and sets width to 40% of the entire width
<br/>
inline : Setting width doesnt affect, width still remains the same
<br/>
inline-block: Width gets set to 40%, however,entire widht viewport isnt occupied by the inline-block elements
